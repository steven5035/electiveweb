    Design Thinking<br>
    This lesson we will be going though this<br><br><br>
    Why is it important?<br>
    It helps people to brain storm what they want to create that might solve their problems<br><br>
    3 things to consider :Snytactic ,Pragmatic ,Semantic<br>
    Snytactic is about materail and diamention of a material<br>
    Pragmatic is about how the item works<br>
    Semantic is about how it heps people<br>
    <br><br><br>
    Examples
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="lesson8-1.png" />
        <style>
            img {
                width: 500px;
                height: 500px;
            }
        </style>
    <p>
        This is a paper detector ,it is made of wood box with ultrasonic sensor and led (snytactic).<br>
        It detect if there is paper ,if paper is less than half of the box ,the led will light up (pragmatic)<br>
        This device is to make sure paper are always avaliable to people who needed it (semantic)<br>
    <p style="text-align:center;">

            }
        </style>
